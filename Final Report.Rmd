# Introduction

Hurricanes are type of storms with high speed winds that form over tropical or subtropical waters. Typically, hurricanes bring about strong winds, storm surges, and heavy rainfall that can lead to flooding, tornadoes, etc. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane scale is used to rate hurricanes by their wind speed -- the higher the category, the greater the possibility of landfall damage. It is worthwhile to understand aspects of hurricanes and make accurate predictions in order to provide appropriate information and resources to the public, make informed decisions, and, potentially save lives.

For this project, we have information about 356 hurricanes in the North Atlantic area since 1989, including the storm's location and maximum windspeed for every 6 hours. Additionally, the dataset includes information about season and month which hurricane occured, nature of the hurricane, and timing of the storm. We are interested in building a bayesian model in order to predict hurricane trajectories, particularly the wind speed at a specific time point.
